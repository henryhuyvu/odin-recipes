    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Someone online and their husband were sick of frying grilled cheeses on the stove because you have so many pieces of bread to use, and you have to stand there for a long time if you feed up to six people like we do. So they came up with this idea.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li> 18 slices bread </li>
          <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
          <li>9 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
      </ul>

    <h4> Steps </h4>
      <ol>
          <li> Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). </li>
          <li> Butter one side of 9 slices of bread, and place butter-side down on a baking sheet. Arrange cheese on each slice of bread. Spread butter on 9 remaining slices of bread, and place them buttered-side up on top of the cheese. </li>
          <li> Bake in preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes. Flip the sandwiches, and bake an additional 6 to 8 minutes, or until golden brown. </li>
      </ol>
