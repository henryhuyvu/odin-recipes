    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method according to someone on the internet. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li> 1 pound uncooked spaghetti </li>
          <li> 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced </li>
          <li> ½ cup olive oil </li>
          <li> ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>            
          <li> salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
          <li> ¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley </li>
          <li> 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
      </ul>

    <h4> Steps </h4>
      <ol>
          <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. </li>
          <li> Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
          <li> Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined. </li>
          <li> Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </li>
      </ol>
